Hercules Plugin Windows Installer
==============================

My name is Arnaud COURTY. I'm a just graduated student at ESILV.

At a Hercules meeting I surprised that it was so difficult to add a plug-in into Hercules installation folder.
So, I write a Windows Application to help you to install Hercules-390 plugin's on Windows


My application is in C# so run only on Windows.
You must have a valid internet connection :)

The server where files are hosted is herculeswinplugin.free.fr
If you want to contact me: herculeswinplugin@free.fr

I will be very happy if you report me all remarks you want.
Thanks in advance.

Arnaud
